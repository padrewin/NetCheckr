# NetCheckr

NetCheckr is a macOS application designed to monitor your internet connection and provide real-time updates. It displays an icon and menu in the system menu bar, sends notifications when you go offline or come back online, and allows you to manage preferences such as launching at login and enabling notifications.

## Features

- **Internet Connection Monitoring:**  
  Utilizes `NWPathMonitor` to detect changes in your online status. You will know when you lose internet connectivity and when it is restored.

- **Menu Bar Integration:**  
  A simple menu bar icon and status text show if you're "Online" or "Offline." When offline, the app also shows how long you've been disconnected.

- **Real-Time Notifications:**  
  Receive a **"No Internet"** notification when the connection is lost and a **"Back Online"** notification when it's restored.  
  Notifications can be enabled or disabled in the appâ€™s settings.

- **Connection History:**  
  View a history of recent offline/online events from a dedicated history window.

- **Customizable Settings:**  
  - **Launch at Login:** Automatically start NetCheckr when you log in.  
  - **Enable Notifications:** Easily toggle notifications on or off.  
  Changes are saved and restored automatically.
